# pncc_asr
An implementation of Power-Normalized Cepstral Coefficients(PNCC) (supports GPU computation)

This code is based on **"Power-Normalized Cepstral CoefÔ¨Åcients (PNCC) for Robust Speech Recognition(Chanwoo Kim, 2016)"**.

< paper link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7439789 >


## Usage
- This code is based on torchaudio; the audio data have to be loaded by torchaudio.
- All parameters follow the origianl paper.

First, Clone this repository and install requirements.
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/LimDoHyeon/pncc_asr.git
cd pncc_asr
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And use this function:
```python
def pncc(
    wav: torch.Tensor,
    sr: int,
    n_fft: int = 1024,
    win_length: int = 400,
    hop_length: int = 160,
    n_ch: int = 40,
    f_min: int = 200,
    f_max: int = 8000,
    n_ceps: int = 13,
) -> torch.Tensor:
```
```python
import torchaudio
import pncc_asr as PNCC

y, sr = torchaudio.load('your_audiofile.wav')
pncc = PNCC.pncc(y, sr)
```
